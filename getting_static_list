Installing the static folder with setuptools is a mess. It looks like in order to work without
problems, it needs to have all the folder specified (otherwise it thinks that, for instance, the wizard
folder is a file).
Use:
ls -R --format="single-column" pyproctgui/ | grep ":"

In order to get an initial list. It can be easily formatted as python list with some regex replacements :)
